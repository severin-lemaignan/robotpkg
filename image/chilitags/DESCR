Chilitags is a C++ cross-platform software library for the detection and
identification of 2D fiducial markers.  They are to be printed and placed on
objects from the real world, to form the basis or Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. Using a camera, the position of the tagged objects can be
acquired by a computer and used to virtually display information on them.

Chilitags was developed internally for projects of the CHILI lab
(Computer-Human Interaction in Learning and Instruction, formerly CRAFT) at
EPFL, such as Metroscope or TapaCarp. There are already many alternatives (e.g.
ARToolKit, or reacTIVision, among many others), but we decided to release
Chilitags anyway, as there seemed to be a demand for it.
